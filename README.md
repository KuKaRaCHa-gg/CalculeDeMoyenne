# 📊 Weighted Average Calculator in Java

This is a beginner-friendly Java console application project designed to help manage subjects and calculate a weighted average based on grades and coefficients. The application also identifies subjects with low grades (below 10).

The project is currently in its early development phase, focusing on setting up the basic structure and functionalities.
